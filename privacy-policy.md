FiscKitâ€™s mission is to make the Canadian Income Tax Act more accessible, understandable, and interactive while respecting your privacy.

### 1. Data We Collect
FiscKit **does not collect any personally identifiable information** (such as your name, email, or phone number) without your explicit consent.

Data types handled:
- **Local data**: Your tax sheets, notes, and favorites are saved only on your device.
- **Anonymous usage data**: Aggregated technical data (e.g., feature usage frequency) may be collected to improve the app experience.
- **Advertising data via Google AdMob**: FiscKit uses Google AdMob to serve ads. Google may collect pseudonymous data (e.g., advertising ID, device type) under its [privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

If collected, data is only used to:
- Provide app functionality
- Answer fiscal questions through the AI assistant
- Display ads (personalized or not)
- Improve performance and app stability

### 3. Data Storage & Security
All user data remains on your device and is not synced with external servers.

Requests sent to the AI assistant are encrypted and anonymized, and handled through secure third-party services (e.g., OpenAI API).

### 4. Advertising & Subscription
FiscKit offers:
- A free version with ads (Google AdMob)
- A paid version without ads

Google may use your deviceâ€™s advertising ID according to their policy. We do not sell or share any personal information.

### 5. User Rights
You may:
- Clear your local data using your deviceâ€™s settings
